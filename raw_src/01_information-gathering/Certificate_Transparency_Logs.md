Certificate Transparency Logs
=============================

* * *

In the sprawling mass of the internet, trust is a fragile commodity. One of the cornerstones of this trust is the `Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security` (`SSL/TLS`) protocol, which encrypts communication between your browser and a website. At the heart of SSL/TLS lies the `digital certificate`, a small file that verifies a website's identity and allows for secure, encrypted communication.

However, the process of issuing and managing these certificates isn't foolproof. Attackers can exploit rogue or mis-issued certificates to impersonate legitimate websites, intercept sensitive data, or spread malware. This is where Certificate Transparency (CT) logs come into play.

What are Certificate Transparency Logs?
---------------------------------------

`Certificate Transparency` (`CT`) logs are public, append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates. Whenever a Certificate Authority (CA) issues a new certificate, it must submit it to multiple CT logs. Independent organisations maintain these logs and are open for anyone to inspect.

Think of CT logs as a `global registry of certificates`. They provide a transparent and verifiable record of every SSL/TLS certificate issued for a website. This transparency serves several crucial purposes:

*   `Early Detection of Rogue Certificates`: By monitoring CT logs, security researchers and website owners can quickly identify suspicious or misissued certificates. A rogue certificate is an unauthorized or fraudulent digital certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority. Detecting these early allows for swift action to revoke the certificates before they can be used for malicious purposes.
*   `Accountability for Certificate Authorities`: CT logs hold CAs accountable for their issuance practices. If a CA issues a certificate that violates the rules or standards, it will be publicly visible in the logs, leading to potential sanctions or loss of trust.
*   `Strengthening the Web PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)`: The Web PKI is the trust system underpinning secure online communication. CT logs help to enhance the security and integrity of the Web PKI by providing a mechanism for public oversight and verification of certificates.

Click to expand a technical breakdown of how CT Logs Work

How Certificate Transparency Logs Work
--------------------------------------

Certificate Transparency logs rely on a clever combination of cryptographic techniques and public accountability:

1.  `Certificate Issuance`: When a website owner requests an `SSL/TLS certificate` from a `Certificate Authority (CA)`, the CA performs due diligence to verify the owner's identity and domain ownership. Once verified, the CA issues a `pre-certificate`, a preliminary certificate version.
2.  `Log Submission`: The CA then submits this `pre-certificate` to multiple CT logs. Each log is operated by a different organisation, ensuring redundancy and decentralisation. The logs are essentially `append-only`, meaning that once a certificate is added, it cannot be modified or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the historical record.
3.  `Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)`: Upon receiving the `pre-certificate`, each CT log generates a `Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)`. This `SCT` is a cryptographic proof that the certificate was submitted to the log at a specific time. The `SCT` is then included in the final certificate issued to the website owner.
4.  `Browser Verification`: When a user's browser connects to a website, it checks the certificate's `SCTs`. These `SCTs` are verified against the public CT logs to confirm that the certificate was issued and logged correctly. If the `SCTs` are valid, the browser establishes a secure connection; if not, it may display a warning to the user.
5.  `Monitoring and Auditing`: CT logs are continuously monitored by various entities, including security researchers, website owners, and `browser vendors`. These monitors look for anomalies or suspicious certificates, such as those issued for domains they don't own or certificates violating industry standards. If any issues are found, they can be reported to the relevant `CA` for investigation and potential revocation of the certificate.

### The Merkle Tree Structure

To ensure CT logs' integrity and tamper-proof nature, they employ a Merkle tree cryptographic structure. This structure organises the certificates in a tree-like fashion, where each leaf node represents a certificate, and each non-leaf node represents a hash of its child nodes. The root of the tree, known as the Merkle root, is a single hash representing the entire log.

Let's visualise this with a hypothetical Merkle tree for `inlanefreight.com`:

![](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/144/diagram-001.png)

In this hypothetical tree:

*   `Root Hash`: The topmost node, a single hash representing the entire log's state.
*   `Hash 1 & Hash 2`: Intermediate nodes, each a hash of two child nodes (either certificates or other hashes).
*   `Cert 1 - Cert 4`: Leaf nodes representing individual SSL/TLS certificates for different subdomains of `inlanefreight.com`.

This structure allows for efficient verification of any certificate in the log. By providing the Merkle path (a series of hashes) for a particular certificate, anyone can verify that it is included in the log without downloading the entire log. For instance, to verify `Cert 2 (blog.inlanefreight.com)`, you would need:

1.  `Cert 2's hash`: This directly verifies the certificate itself.
2.  `Hash 1`: Verifies that Cert 2's hash is correctly paired with Cert 1's hash.
3.  `Root Hash`: Confirms that Hash 1 is a valid part of the overall log structure.

This process ensures that even if a single bit of data in a certificate or the log itself is altered, the root hash will change, immediately signaling tampering. This makes CT logs an invaluable tool for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of SSL/TLS certificates, ultimately enhancing internet security.

  

CT Logs and Web Recon
---------------------

Certificate Transparency logs offer a unique advantage in subdomain enumeration compared to other methods. Unlike brute-forcing or wordlist-based approaches, which rely on guessing or predicting subdomain names, CT logs provide a definitive record of certificates issued for a domain and its subdomains. This means you're not limited by the scope of your wordlist or the effectiveness of your brute-forcing algorithm. Instead, you gain access to a historical and comprehensive view of a domain's subdomains, including those that might not be actively used or easily guessable.

Furthermore, CT logs can unveil subdomains associated with old or expired certificates. These subdomains might host outdated software or configurations, making them potentially vulnerable to exploitation.

In essence, CT logs provide a reliable and efficient way to discover subdomains without the need for exhaustive brute-forcing or relying on the completeness of wordlists. They offer a unique window into a domain's history and can reveal subdomains that might otherwise remain hidden, significantly enhancing your reconnaissance capabilities.

Searching CT Logs
-----------------

There are two popular options for searching CT logs:

Tool

Key Features

Use Cases

Pros

Cons

[crt.sh](https://crt.sh/)

User-friendly web interface, simple search by domain, displays certificate details, SAN entries.

Quick and easy searches, identifying subdomains, checking certificate issuance history.

Free, easy to use, no registration required.

Limited filtering and analysis options.

[Censys](https://search.censys.io/)

Powerful search engine for internet-connected devices, advanced filtering by domain, IP, certificate attributes.

In-depth analysis of certificates, identifying misconfigurations, finding related certificates and hosts.

Extensive data and filtering options, API access.

Requires registration (free tier available).

### crt.sh lookup

While `crt.sh` offers a convenient web interface, you can also leverage its API for automated searches directly from your terminal. Let's see how to find all 'dev' subdomains on `facebook.com` using `curl` and `jq`:

        shellsession
`titagram@htb[/htb]$ curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[]  | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u   *.dev.facebook.com *.newdev.facebook.com *.secure.dev.facebook.com dev.facebook.com devvm1958.ftw3.facebook.com facebook-amex-dev.facebook.com facebook-amex-sign-enc-dev.facebook.com newdev.facebook.com secure.dev.facebook.com`

*   `curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json"`: This command fetches the JSON output from crt.sh for certificates matching the domain `facebook.com`.
*   `jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value'`: This part filters the JSON results, selecting only entries where the `name_value` field (which contains the domain or subdomain) includes the string "`dev`". The `-r` flag tells `jq` to output raw strings.
*   `sort -u`: This sorts the results alphabetically and removes duplicates.

Cheat Sheet
===========

* * *

Web reconnaissance is the first step in any security assessment or penetration testing engagement. It's akin to a detective's initial investigation, meticulously gathering clues and evidence about a target before formulating a plan of action. In the digital realm, this translates to accumulating information about a website or web application to identify potential vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and valuable assets.

The primary goals of web reconnaissance revolve around gaining a comprehensive understanding of the target's digital footprint. This includes:

*   `Identifying Assets`: Discovering all associated domains, subdomains, and IP addresses provides a map of the target's online presence.
*   `Uncovering Hidden Information`: Web reconnaissance aims to uncover directories, files, and technologies that are not readily apparent and could serve as entry points for an attacker.
*   `Analyzing the Attack Surface`: By identifying open ports, running services, and software versions, you can assess the potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the target.
*   `Gathering Intelligence`: Collecting information about employees, email addresses, and technologies used can aid in social engineering attacks or identifying specific vulnerabilities associated with certain software.

Web reconnaissance can be conducted using either active or passive techniques, each with its own advantages and drawbacks:

Type

Description

Risk of Detection

Examples

Active Reconnaissance

Involves directly interacting with the target system, such as sending probes or requests.

Higher

Port scanning, vulnerability scanning, network mapping

Passive Reconnaissance

Gathers information without directly interacting with the target, relying on publicly available data.

Lower

Search engine queries, WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, web archive analysis, social media

WHOIS
-----

WHOIS is a query and response protocol used to retrieve information about domain names, IP addresses, and other internet resources. It's essentially a directory service that details who owns a domain, when it was registered, contact information, and more. In the context of web reconnaissance, WHOIS lookups can be a valuable source of information, potentially revealing the identity of the website owner, their contact information, and other details that could be used for further investigation or social engineering attacks.

For example, if you wanted to find out who owns the domain `example.com`, you could run the following command in your terminal:

        bash
`whois example.com`

This would return a wealth of information, including the registrar, registration, and expiration dates, nameservers, and contact information for the domain owner.

However, it's important to note that WHOIS data can be inaccurate or intentionally obscured, so it's always wise to verify the information from multiple sources. Privacy services can also mask the true owner of a domain, making it more difficult to obtain accurate information through WHOIS.

DNS
---

The Domain Name System (DNS) functions as the internet's GPS, translating user-friendly domain names into the numerical IP addresses computers use to communicate. Like GPS converting a destination's name into coordinates, DNS ensures your browser reaches the correct website by matching its name with its IP address. This eliminates memorizing complex numerical addresses, making web navigation seamless and efficient.

The `dig` command allows you to query DNS servers directly, retrieving specific information about domain names. For instance, if you want to find the IP address associated with `example.com`, you can execute the following command:

        bash
`dig example.com A`

This command instructs `dig` to query the DNS for the `A` record (which maps a hostname to an IPv4 address) of `example.com`. The output will typically include the requested IP address, along with additional details about the query and response. By mastering the `dig` command and understanding the various DNS record types, you gain the ability to extract valuable information about a target's infrastructure and online presence.

DNS servers store various types of records, each serving a specific purpose:

Record Type

Description

A

Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.

AAAA

Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.

CNAME

Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.

MX

Specifies mail servers responsible for handling email for the domain.

NS

Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.

TXT

Stores arbitrary text information.

SOA

Contains administrative information about a DNS zone.

Subdomains
----------

Subdomains are essentially extensions of a primary domain name, often used to organize different sections or services within a website. For example, a company might use `mail.example.com` for their email server or `blog.example.com` for their blog.

From a reconnaissance perspective, subdomains are incredibly valuable. They can expose additional attack surfaces, reveal hidden services, and provide clues about the internal structure of a target's network. Subdomains might host development servers, staging environments, or even forgotten applications that haven't been properly secured.

The process of discovering subdomains is known as subdomain enumeration. There are two main approaches to subdomain enumeration:

Approach

Description

Examples

`Active Enumeration`

Directly interacts with the target's DNS servers or utilizes tools to probe for subdomains.

Brute-forcing, DNS zone transfers

`Passive Enumeration`

Collects information about subdomains without directly interacting with the target, relying on public sources.

Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, search engine queries

`Active enumeration` can be more thorough but carries a higher risk of detection. Conversely, `passive enumeration` is stealthier but may not uncover all subdomains. Combining both techniques can significantly increase the likelihood of discovering a comprehensive list of subdomains associated with your target, expanding your understanding of their online presence and potential vulnerabilities.

### Subdomain Brute-Forcing

Subdomain brute-forcing is a proactive technique used in web reconnaissance to uncover subdomains that may not be readily apparent through passive methods. It involves systematically generating many potential subdomain names and testing them against the target's DNS server to see if they exist. This approach can unveil hidden subdomains that may host valuable information, development servers, or vulnerable applications.

One of the most versatile tools for subdomain brute-forcing is `dnsenum`. This powerful command-line tool combines various DNS enumeration techniques, including dictionary-based brute-forcing, to uncover subdomains associated with your target.

To use `dnsenum` for subdomain brute-forcing, you'll typically provide it with the target domain and a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. The tool will then systematically query the DNS server for each potential subdomain and report any that exist.

For example, the following command would attempt to brute-force subdomains of `example.com` using a wordlist named `subdomains.txt`:

        bash
`dnsenum example.com -f subdomains.txt`

### Zone Transfers

DNS zone transfers, also known as AXFR (Asynchronous Full Transfer) requests, offer a potential goldmine of information for web reconnaissance. A zone transfer is a mechanism for replicating DNS data across servers. When a zone transfer is successful, it provides a complete copy of the DNS zone file, which contains a wealth of details about the target domain.

This zone file lists all the domain's subdomains, their associated IP addresses, mail server configurations, and other DNS records. This is akin to obtaining a blueprint of the target's DNS infrastructure for a reconnaissance expert.

To attempt a zone transfer, you can use the `dig` command with the `axfr` (full zone transfer) option. For example, to request a zone transfer from the DNS server `ns1.example.com` for the domain `example.com`, you would execute:

        bash
`dig @ns1.example.com example.com axfr`

However, zone transfers are not always permitted. Many DNS servers are configured to restrict zone transfers to authorized secondary servers only. Misconfigured servers, though, may allow zone transfers from any source, inadvertently exposing sensitive information.

### Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosting is a technique that allows multiple websites to share a single IP address. Each website is associated with a unique hostname, which is used to direct incoming requests to the correct site. This can be a cost-effective way for organizations to host multiple websites on a single server, but it can also create a challenge for web reconnaissance.

Since multiple websites share the same IP address, simply scanning the IP won't reveal all the hosted sites. You need a tool that can test different hostnames against the IP address to see which ones respond.

Gobuster is a versatile tool that can be used for various types of brute-forcing, including virtual host discovery. Its `vhost` mode is designed to enumerate virtual hosts by sending requests to the target IP address with different hostnames. If a virtual host is configured for a specific hostname, Gobuster will receive a response from the web server.

To use Gobuster to brute-force virtual hosts, you'll need a wordlist containing potential hostnames. Here's an example command:

        bash
`gobuster vhost -u http://192.0.2.1 -w hostnames.txt`

In this example, `-u` specifies the target IP address, and `-w` specifies the wordlist file. Gobuster will then systematically try each hostname in the wordlist and report any that results in a valid response from the web server.

### Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs

Certificate Transparency (CT) logs offer a treasure trove of subdomain information for passive reconnaissance. These publicly accessible logs record SSL/TLS certificates issued for domains and their subdomains, serving as a security measure to prevent fraudulent certificates. For reconnaissance, they offer a window into potentially overlooked subdomains.

The `crt.sh` website provides a searchable interface for CT logs. To efficiently extract subdomains using `crt.sh` within your terminal, you can use a command like this:

        bash
`curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%25.example.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u`

This command fetches JSON-formatted data from `crt.sh` for `example.com` (the `%` is a wildcard), extracts domain names using `jq`, removes any wildcard prefixes (`*.`) with `sed`, and finally sorts and deduplicates the results.

Web Crawling
------------

Web crawling is the automated exploration of a website's structure. A web crawler, or spider, systematically navigates through web pages by following links, mimicking a user's browsing behavior. This process maps out the site's architecture and gathers valuable information embedded within the pages.

A crucial file that guides web crawlers is `robots.txt`. This file resides in a website's root directory and dictates which areas are off-limits for crawlers. Analyzing `robots.txt` can reveal hidden directories or sensitive areas that the website owner doesn't want to be indexed by search engines.

`Scrapy` is a powerful and efficient Python framework for large-scale web crawling and scraping projects. It provides a structured approach to defining crawling rules, extracting data, and handling various output formats.

Here's a basic Scrapy spider example to extract links from `example.com`:

        python
`import scrapy  class ExampleSpider(scrapy.Spider):     name = "example"     start_urls = ['http://example.com/']      def parse(self, response):         for link in response.css('a::attr(href)').getall():             if any(link.endswith(ext) for ext in self.interesting_extensions):                 yield {"file": link}             elif not link.startswith("#") and not link.startswith("mailto:"):                 yield response.follow(link, callback=self.parse)`

After running the Scrapy spider, you'll have a file containing scraped data (e.g., `example_data.json`). You can analyze these results using standard command-line tools. For instance, to extract all links:

        bash
`jq -r '.[] | select(.file != null) | .file' example_data.json | sort -u`

This command uses `jq` to extract links, `awk` to isolate file extensions, `sort` to order them, and `uniq -c` to count their occurrences. By scrutinizing the extracted data, you can identify patterns, anomalies, or sensitive files that might be of interest for further investigation.

Search Engine Discovery
-----------------------

Leveraging search engines for reconnaissance involves utilizing their vast indexes of web content to uncover information about your target. This passive technique, often referred to as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering, can yield valuable insights without directly interacting with the target's systems.

By employing advanced search operators and specialized queries known as "Google Dorks," you can pinpoint specific information buried within search results. Here's a table of some useful search operators for web reconnaissance:

Operator

Description

Example

`site:`

Restricts search results to a specific website.

`site:example.com "password reset"`

`inurl:`

Searches for a specific term in the URL of a page.

`inurl:admin login`

`filetype:`

Limits results to files of a specific type.

`filetype:pdf "confidential report"`

`intitle:`

Searches for a term within the title of a page.

`intitle:"index of" /backup`

`cache:`

Shows the cached version of a webpage.

`cache:example.com`

`"search term"`

Searches for the exact phrase within quotation marks.

`"internal error" site:example.com`

`OR`

Combines multiple search terms.

`inurl:admin OR inurl:login`

`-`

Excludes specific terms from search results.

`inurl:admin -intext:wordpress`

By creatively combining these operators and crafting targeted queries, you can uncover sensitive documents, exposed directories, login pages, and other valuable information that may aid in your reconnaissance efforts.

Web Archives
------------

Web archives are digital repositories that store snapshots of websites across time, providing a historical record of their evolution. Among these archives, the Wayback Machine is the most comprehensive and accessible resource for web reconnaissance.

The Wayback Machine, a project by the Internet Archive, has been archiving the web for over two decades, capturing billions of web pages from across the globe. This massive historical data collection can be an invaluable resource for security researchers and investigators.

Feature

Description
