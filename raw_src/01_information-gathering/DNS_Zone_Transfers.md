DNS Zone Transfers
==================

* * *

While brute-forcing can be a fruitful approach, there's a less invasive and potentially more efficient method for uncovering subdomains – DNS zone transfers. This mechanism, designed for replicating DNS records between name servers, can inadvertently become a goldmine of information for prying eyes if misconfigured.

What is a Zone Transfer
-----------------------

A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers. However, if not adequately secured, unauthorised parties can download the entire zone file, revealing a complete list of subdomains, their associated IP addresses, and other sensitive DNS data.

![Diagram showing data transfer between secondary and primary servers. Includes steps: XML Request, XML Record, loop for retries, XML Report, and AOK (Acknowledgment).](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/144/ig_dns_zone_transfers_1.png)

1.  `Zone Transfer Request (AXFR)`: The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.
2.  `SOA Record Transfer`: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record. The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.
3.  `DNS Records Transmission`: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one. This includes records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and others that define the domain's subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other configurations.
4.  `Zone Transfer Complete`: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.
5.  `Acknowledgement (ACK)`: The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.

The Zone Transfer Vulnerability
-------------------------------

While zone transfers are essential for legitimate DNS management, a misconfigured DNS server can transform this process into a significant security vulnerability. The core issue lies in the access controls governing who can initiate a zone transfer.

In the early days of the internet, allowing any client to request a zone transfer from a DNS server was common practice. This open approach simplified administration but opened a gaping security hole. It meant that anyone, including malicious actors, could ask a DNS server for a complete copy of its zone file, which contains a wealth of sensitive information.

The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

*   `Subdomains`: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
*   `IP Addresses`: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
*   `Name Server Records`: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.

### Remediation

Fortunately, awareness of this vulnerability has grown, and most DNS server administrators have mitigated the risk. Modern DNS servers are typically configured to allow zone transfers only to trusted secondary servers, ensuring that sensitive zone data remains confidential.

However, misconfigurations can still occur due to human error or outdated practices. This is why attempting a zone transfer (with proper authorisation) remains a valuable reconnaissance technique. Even if unsuccessful, the attempt can reveal information about the DNS server's configuration and security posture.

#### Exploiting Zone Transfers

You can use the `dig` command to request a zone transfer:

        shellsession
`titagram@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me`

This command instructs `dig` to request a full zone transfer (`axfr`) from the DNS server responsible for `zonetransfer.me`. If the server is misconfigured and allows the transfer, you'll receive a complete list of DNS records for the domain, including all subdomains.

        shellsession
`titagram@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me  ; <<>> DiG 9.18.12-1~bpo11+1-Debian <<>> axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me ; (1 server found) ;; global options: +cmd zonetransfer.me.    7200    IN  SOA nsztm1.digi.ninja. robin.digi.ninja. 2019100801 172800 900 1209600 3600 zonetransfer.me.    300 IN  HINFO   "Casio fx-700G" "Windows XP" zonetransfer.me.    301 IN  TXT "google-site-verification=tyP28J7JAUHA9fw2sHXMgcCC0I6XBmmoVi04VlMewxA" zonetransfer.me.    7200    IN  MX  0 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. ... zonetransfer.me.    7200    IN  A   5.196.105.14 zonetransfer.me.    7200    IN  NS  nsztm1.digi.ninja. zonetransfer.me.    7200    IN  NS  nsztm2.digi.ninja. _acme-challenge.zonetransfer.me. 301 IN TXT "6Oa05hbUJ9xSsvYy7pApQvwCUSSGgxvrbdizjePEsZI" _sip._tcp.zonetransfer.me. 14000 IN SRV 0 0 5060 www.zonetransfer.me. 14.105.196.5.IN-ADDR.ARPA.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN PTR www.zonetransfer.me. asfdbauthdns.zonetransfer.me. 7900 IN   AFSDB   1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. 7200  IN  A   127.0.0.1 asfdbvolume.zonetransfer.me. 7800 IN    AFSDB   1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. canberra-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A  202.14.81.230 ... ;; Query time: 10 msec ;; SERVER: 81.4.108.41#53(nsztm1.digi.ninja) (TCP) ;; WHEN: Mon May 27 18:31:35 BST 2024 ;; XFR size: 50 records (messages 1, bytes 2085)`

`zonetransfer.me` is a service specifically setup to demonstrate the risks of zone transfers so that the `dig` command will return the full zone record.

Cheat Sheet
===========

* * *

Web reconnaissance is the first step in any security assessment or penetration testing engagement. It's akin to a detective's initial investigation, meticulously gathering clues and evidence about a target before formulating a plan of action. In the digital realm, this translates to accumulating information about a website or web application to identify potential vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and valuable assets.

The primary goals of web reconnaissance revolve around gaining a comprehensive understanding of the target's digital footprint. This includes:

*   `Identifying Assets`: Discovering all associated domains, subdomains, and IP addresses provides a map of the target's online presence.
*   `Uncovering Hidden Information`: Web reconnaissance aims to uncover directories, files, and technologies that are not readily apparent and could serve as entry points for an attacker.
*   `Analyzing the Attack Surface`: By identifying open ports, running services, and software versions, you can assess the potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the target.
*   `Gathering Intelligence`: Collecting information about employees, email addresses, and technologies used can aid in social engineering attacks or identifying specific vulnerabilities associated with certain software.

Web reconnaissance can be conducted using either active or passive techniques, each with its own advantages and drawbacks:

Type

Description

Risk of Detection

Examples

Active Reconnaissance

Involves directly interacting with the target system, such as sending probes or requests.

Higher

Port scanning, vulnerability scanning, network mapping

Passive Reconnaissance

Gathers information without directly interacting with the target, relying on publicly available data.

Lower

Search engine queries, WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, web archive analysis, social media

WHOIS
-----

WHOIS is a query and response protocol used to retrieve information about domain names, IP addresses, and other internet resources. It's essentially a directory service that details who owns a domain, when it was registered, contact information, and more. In the context of web reconnaissance, WHOIS lookups can be a valuable source of information, potentially revealing the identity of the website owner, their contact information, and other details that could be used for further investigation or social engineering attacks.

For example, if you wanted to find out who owns the domain `example.com`, you could run the following command in your terminal:

        bash
`whois example.com`

This would return a wealth of information, including the registrar, registration, and expiration dates, nameservers, and contact information for the domain owner.

However, it's important to note that WHOIS data can be inaccurate or intentionally obscured, so it's always wise to verify the information from multiple sources. Privacy services can also mask the true owner of a domain, making it more difficult to obtain accurate information through WHOIS.

DNS
---

The Domain Name System (DNS) functions as the internet's GPS, translating user-friendly domain names into the numerical IP addresses computers use to communicate. Like GPS converting a destination's name into coordinates, DNS ensures your browser reaches the correct website by matching its name with its IP address. This eliminates memorizing complex numerical addresses, making web navigation seamless and efficient.

The `dig` command allows you to query DNS servers directly, retrieving specific information about domain names. For instance, if you want to find the IP address associated with `example.com`, you can execute the following command:

        bash
`dig example.com A`

This command instructs `dig` to query the DNS for the `A` record (which maps a hostname to an IPv4 address) of `example.com`. The output will typically include the requested IP address, along with additional details about the query and response. By mastering the `dig` command and understanding the various DNS record types, you gain the ability to extract valuable information about a target's infrastructure and online presence.

DNS servers store various types of records, each serving a specific purpose:

Record Type

Description

A

Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.

AAAA

Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.

CNAME

Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.

MX

Specifies mail servers responsible for handling email for the domain.

NS

Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.

TXT

Stores arbitrary text information.

SOA

Contains administrative information about a DNS zone.

Subdomains
----------

Subdomains are essentially extensions of a primary domain name, often used to organize different sections or services within a website. For example, a company might use `mail.example.com` for their email server or `blog.example.com` for their blog.

From a reconnaissance perspective, subdomains are incredibly valuable. They can expose additional attack surfaces, reveal hidden services, and provide clues about the internal structure of a target's network. Subdomains might host development servers, staging environments, or even forgotten applications that haven't been properly secured.

The process of discovering subdomains is known as subdomain enumeration. There are two main approaches to subdomain enumeration:

Approach

Description

Examples

`Active Enumeration`

Directly interacts with the target's DNS servers or utilizes tools to probe for subdomains.

Brute-forcing, DNS zone transfers

`Passive Enumeration`

Collects information about subdomains without directly interacting with the target, relying on public sources.

Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, search engine queries

`Active enumeration` can be more thorough but carries a higher risk of detection. Conversely, `passive enumeration` is stealthier but may not uncover all subdomains. Combining both techniques can significantly increase the likelihood of discovering a comprehensive list of subdomains associated with your target, expanding your understanding of their online presence and potential vulnerabilities.

### Subdomain Brute-Forcing

Subdomain brute-forcing is a proactive technique used in web reconnaissance to uncover subdomains that may not be readily apparent through passive methods. It involves systematically generating many potential subdomain names and testing them against the target's DNS server to see if they exist. This approach can unveil hidden subdomains that may host valuable information, development servers, or vulnerable applications.

One of the most versatile tools for subdomain brute-forcing is `dnsenum`. This powerful command-line tool combines various DNS enumeration techniques, including dictionary-based brute-forcing, to uncover subdomains associated with your target.

To use `dnsenum` for subdomain brute-forcing, you'll typically provide it with the target domain and a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. The tool will then systematically query the DNS server for each potential subdomain and report any that exist.

For example, the following command would attempt to brute-force subdomains of `example.com` using a wordlist named `subdomains.txt`:

        bash
`dnsenum example.com -f subdomains.txt`

### Zone Transfers

DNS zone transfers, also known as AXFR (Asynchronous Full Transfer) requests, offer a potential goldmine of information for web reconnaissance. A zone transfer is a mechanism for replicating DNS data across servers. When a zone transfer is successful, it provides a complete copy of the DNS zone file, which contains a wealth of details about the target domain.

This zone file lists all the domain's subdomains, their associated IP addresses, mail server configurations, and other DNS records. This is akin to obtaining a blueprint of the target's DNS infrastructure for a reconnaissance expert.

To attempt a zone transfer, you can use the `dig` command with the `axfr` (full zone transfer) option. For example, to request a zone transfer from the DNS server `ns1.example.com` for the domain `example.com`, you would execute:

        bash
`dig @ns1.example.com example.com axfr`

However, zone transfers are not always permitted. Many DNS servers are configured to restrict zone transfers to authorized secondary servers only. Misconfigured servers, though, may allow zone transfers from any source, inadvertently exposing sensitive information.

### Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosting is a technique that allows multiple websites to share a single IP address. Each website is associated with a unique hostname, which is used to direct incoming requests to the correct site. This can be a cost-effective way for organizations to host multiple websites on a single server, but it can also create a challenge for web reconnaissance.

Since multiple websites share the same IP address, simply scanning the IP won't reveal all the hosted sites. You need a tool that can test different hostnames against the IP address to see which ones respond.

Gobuster is a versatile tool that can be used for various types of brute-forcing, including virtual host discovery. Its `vhost` mode is designed to enumerate virtual hosts by sending requests to the target IP address with different hostnames. If a virtual host is configured for a specific hostname, Gobuster will receive a response from the web server.

To use Gobuster to brute-force virtual hosts, you'll need a wordlist containing potential hostnames. Here's an example command:

        bash
`gobuster vhost -u http://192.0.2.1 -w hostnames.txt`

In this example, `-u` specifies the target IP address, and `-w` specifies the wordlist file. Gobuster will then systematically try each hostname in the wordlist and report any that results in a valid response from the web server.

### Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs

Certificate Transparency (CT) logs offer a treasure trove of subdomain information for passive reconnaissance. These publicly accessible logs record SSL/TLS certificates issued for domains and their subdomains, serving as a security measure to prevent fraudulent certificates. For reconnaissance, they offer a window into potentially overlooked subdomains.

The `crt.sh` website provides a searchable interface for CT logs. To efficiently extract subdomains using `crt.sh` within your terminal, you can use a command like this:

        bash
`curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%25.example.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u`

This command fetches JSON-formatted data from `crt.sh` for `example.com` (the `%` is a wildcard), extracts domain names using `jq`, removes any wildcard prefixes (`*.`) with `sed`, and finally sorts and deduplicates the results.

Web Crawling
------------

Web crawling is the automated exploration of a website's structure. A web crawler, or spider, systematically navigates through web pages by following links, mimicking a user's browsing behavior. This process maps out the site's architecture and gathers valuable information embedded within the pages.

A crucial file that guides web crawlers is `robots.txt`. This file resides in a website's root directory and dictates which areas are off-limits for crawlers. Analyzing `robots.txt` can reveal hidden directories or sensitive areas that the website owner doesn't want to be indexed by search engines.

`Scrapy` is a powerful and efficient Python framework for large-scale web crawling and scraping projects. It provides a structured approach to defining crawling rules, extracting data, and handling various output formats.

Here's a basic Scrapy spider example to extract links from `example.com`:

        python
`import scrapy  class ExampleSpider(scrapy.Spider):     name = "example"     start_urls = ['http://example.com/']      def parse(self, response):         for link in response.css('a::attr(href)').getall():             if any(link.endswith(ext) for ext in self.interesting_extensions):                 yield {"file": link}             elif not link.startswith("#") and not link.startswith("mailto:"):                 yield response.follow(link, callback=self.parse)`

After running the Scrapy spider, you'll have a file containing scraped data (e.g., `example_data.json`). You can analyze these results using standard command-line tools. For instance, to extract all links:

        bash
`jq -r '.[] | select(.file != null) | .file' example_data.json | sort -u`

This command uses `jq` to extract links, `awk` to isolate file extensions, `sort` to order them, and `uniq -c` to count their occurrences. By scrutinizing the extracted data, you can identify patterns, anomalies, or sensitive files that might be of interest for further investigation.

Search Engine Discovery
-----------------------

Leveraging search engines for reconnaissance involves utilizing their vast indexes of web content to uncover information about your target. This passive technique, often referred to as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering, can yield valuable insights without directly interacting with the target's systems.

By employing advanced search operators and specialized queries known as "Google Dorks," you can pinpoint specific information buried within search results. Here's a table of some useful search operators for web reconnaissance:

Operator

Description

Example

`site:`

Restricts search results to a specific website.

`site:example.com "password reset"`

`inurl:`

Searches for a specific term in the URL of a page.

`inurl:admin login`

`filetype:`

Limits results to files of a specific type.

`filetype:pdf "confidential report"`

`intitle:`

Searches for a term within the title of a page.

`intitle:"index of" /backup`

`cache:`

Shows the cached version of a webpage.

`cache:example.com`

`"search term"`

Searches for the exact phrase within quotation marks.

`"internal error" site:example.com`

`OR`

Combines multiple search terms.

`inurl:admin OR inurl:login`

`-`

Excludes specific terms from search results.

`inurl:admin -intext:wordpress`

By creatively combining these operators and crafting targeted queries, you can uncover sensitive documents, exposed directories, login pages, and other valuable information that may aid in your reconnaissance efforts.

Web Archives
------------

Web archives are digital repositories that store snapshots of websites across time, providing a historical record of their evolution. Among these archives, the Wayback Machine is the most comprehensive and accessible resource for web reconnaissance.

The Wayback Machine, a project by the Internet Archive, has been archiving the web for over two decades, capturing billions of web pages from across the globe. This massive historical data collection can be an invaluable resource for security researchers and investigators.
